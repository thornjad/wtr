# wtr

Get current weather. Doesn't get much simpler than this

## Prerequisites

`wtr` requires `libcurl`, which is usually preinstalled on UNIX-like systems.

## Install

```
make install
```

## Use

```
wtr
wtr Houston
wtr Paris
```

## Todo

wtr does not currently support multi-word searches, no even "San Fransisco".
This is planned for the next version.
